PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This graphical web crawler is responsible for searching 
through links from a starting web page and displaying the results through a 
graphical interface.


PROJECT STRUCTURE: This project contains directories for project modules, 
testing, and documentation. Code will also be maintained in the root of the 
project directory.


TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:
HTML pages are provided (in the Testing directory) for use in testing along 
with test scripts for the crawler component of the project. To use these, 
follow the instructions below:

1. Host the templates in a place of your choosing
2. Update the ROOT_URL variable in the test scripts
3. Use a commandline utility to call the test script from the project root
	EXAMPLE: "python3 .\Testing\test_get_links.py"
	NOTE: If you try to call the test scripts from the Testing directory,
		Python will fail to find the module.
